https://ooifb.org/meetings/apply-to-select-the-next-location-of-the-pioneer-array/

The National Science Foundation is considering the relocation of the Ocean Observing Initiative's Coastal PIONEER Array (https://oceanobservatories.org/array/coastal-pioneer-array/). This is a Coastal Pioneer Array is currently located off the coast of New England where it has operated for the past 5 years. 

The array is designed to be relocatable to enable new science and observations at other critical regions of the ocean. The process to consider if/where/when/how of the PIONEER Array is now underway. This GitHub repository is set up to facilitate open and constructive discussions about this relocation effort.
